# user_app 
Hello - this is my first Vue app.
Using this example, I am learning to work with data, make queries, and generally master the framework.

#Functionality
- Exchange calculator (now is error when try to fetch actual data on git hub pages)
- Login/Register form 
- Account form (you can change data, it saved in database)
- Weather (fech actual weathe also to be fixed in git hub pages, because its work correct locally)
- Posts feature - posts are save in database.


## Refactoring after 1.5 year :) 
#To Do 
- fix api errors for deployed app on git hub
- refactor styles
- remove unused code
- optimize fetch 

To authenticate, you can register (real address is not required) or use a test account:

login: guest@test.com
pass: 111111

## Local Project setup
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
