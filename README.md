# user_app 
Hello - this is my first Vue app.
Using this example, I am learning to work with data, make queries, and generally master the framework.

To authenticate, you can register (real address is not required) or use a test account:
login: guest@test.com
pass: 111111

## Project setup
```
npm install
```
```
npm run serve
```
